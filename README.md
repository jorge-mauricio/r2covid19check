# Rad Square - COVID-19Check
The application was done in a framework I built from scratch. The purpose of the application is to make a series of questions to the collaborator, in order to store the results in a database and, depending on the result, give access to the system by cookie authentication. 

For the React frontend, I built using a server side rendering architecture.
